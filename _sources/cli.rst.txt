Command-line reference
======================

.. note::
   Issuing the ``pyziggy`` command is interchangeable with issuing ``python -m pyziggy``. With this
   you can easily debug any command by creating a run configuration in PyCharm, and selecting the
   module option and specifying ``pyziggy`` in the text field.

.. argparse::
   :ref: pyziggy.cli._make_parser
   :prog: pyziggy
